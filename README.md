Payment processing is handled through Razorpay with the following flow:
1. Order creation on the backend
2. Generation of Razorpay order ID
3. Frontend payment initiation using Razorpay's JavaScript SDK
4. Handling payment success/failure
5. Order status update via webhooks
6. Transaction recording in the database

### Responsive Design Strategy
The application uses Tailwind CSS with a mobile-first approach. Key considerations include:
